## Let's talk a little bit about the commands
Unlike **some** people think, Karu can not only use the mentions (because in some cases it is annoying for the person whom we mention). That's why I thought about you as much as the person so they don't have a problem and we add the **ID**.

With this implementation we can in the case of giving a hug, to give it without having to bother with the mentions. It is worth mentioning that abuse in this way can reflect problems called "Spam".

* A simple example using the command **slap**:
>- Normal:	//slap @BulzyKrown#9999
>- ID: //slap 401946440332476426

If in case you do not know to take the ID or do not see any form we have two ways to remove:

### Method 1: Using Karu
Karu brings built in the command **UserInfo** which allows you to get the user information both mentioned and get your ID (this sounds like removing scissors from the wrapper but you need scissors to remove them).

### Method 2: Discord developed mode
Discord has functions that do not bring the default active, of course normal users would not find sense to strange numbers. Well, in this case these numbers will serve us in replacement of the mentions and the way to activate it is as follows:

#### Step 1:
Go to "User settings"

#### Step 2:
Search and click on the "Appearance" option

#### Step 3:
Go to the end of the **"Appearance"** section and find the "developer Mode" option, click to enable the button in the upper right corner of that option.

With this you can see something like this:
